# Rock-Paper-Scissors

The first project for The Odin Project.

## What did I learn?

1. **Setting up TypeScript**
   This was my first project where I used TypeScript. I made it a goal to learn TS along with JavaScript at the same time. To make the path less steep, I only added type annotations when TS complained about "any" type.

2. **Setting up dev tools**
   I used helpful guides listed online and set up eslint and prettier. I am not at a position yet to explain how they work, but I am learning more as I go.

3. **Figuring out TSC**
   I learned more about the compiler options and found the `tsc -w` command really useful. It was also really informative looking at the .js output file to see what TS does. Most of the code was identical to the TS file.

4. **Functions**
   I learned how to encapsulate all variables inside functions to keep the global space less polluted. I learned more about scopes (function and lexical) and used `const` where I could.

   However, I had to use `.addEventListener` outside a function and there were some functions that were modifying objects outside their scope, despite my best efforts in putting state into object literals.

5. **Branching and Looping**
   I decided to use switch statements because I found the nested if-else statements visually overwhelming. I like having a switch, then one nesting of if-else - this made the code easier on the eyes.

6. **Debugger**
   The browser debugger was amazing! Using breakpoints, I stepped through the entire script and was able to see how the values continually changed. Best part was stepping inside loops. Made everything significantly easier than peppering my code with `console.log()`s.

## What do I need to learn?

1. More css properties and alignment, especially flex and grid.
2. Make things more aesthetically pleasing
3. How to avoid modifying values outside function scope.
4. git...accidentally deleted entire work and had to restore
